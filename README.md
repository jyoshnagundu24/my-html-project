I created a playful little webpage as a fun way to ask my friend to be my Valentine! The page is simple, creative, and full of charm -- it's is a lighthearted, 
personal twist on the classic Valentine's note, designed to make them smile and feel special. It was a small but fun project where I got to combine creativity, 
coding, and bit of fun!
